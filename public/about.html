    <h1>Badapple</h1>
    <h3>(Bioassay-Data Associative Promiscuity Pattern Learning Engine)</h3>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This web app analyzes each input query molecule by searching a database of bioactivity data experimentally 
        produced by NIH screening centers (data from <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank">PubChem</a>). For each scaffold in the query molecule, the Badapple promiscuity score (pScore) 
        is computed according to the following scaffold scoring formula:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <pre>
score = ((sActive) / (sTested + median(sTested)) *
        (aActive) / (aTested + median(aTested)) *
        (wActive) / (wTested + median(wTested)) *
        1e5)
        </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>where:</p>
    <blockquote>    
        <p>sTested (substances tested) = # tested substances containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>sActive (substances active) = # active substances containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>aTested (assays tested) = # assays with tested compounds containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>aActive (assays active) = # assays with active compounds containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>wTested (wells tested) = # wells (samples) containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>wActive (wells active) = # active wells (samples) containing this scaffold</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The <b>inDrug</b> flag indicates whether the corresponding scaffold exists in any approved drug. 
        A high score for an inDrug scaffold thus represents conflicting evidence, but existence of an 
        approved drug is normally much stronger evidence.</p>
    <h3>Interpreting Scores</h3>
    <p>The table below provides an overview of how to interpret different pScores provided by Badapple.</p>
    <table border>
        <tr><th>pScore range</th><th>advisory</th></tr>
        <tr bgcolor="#d1d5db"><td>~</td>
        <td>unknown; no data</td></tr>
        <tr bgcolor="#86efac"><td>0-99</td>
        <td>low pScore; no indication</td></tr>
        <tr bgcolor="#fde68a"><td>100-300</td>
        <td>moderate pScore; weak indication of promiscuity</td></tr>
        <tr bgcolor="#fca5a5"><td>>300</td>
        <td>high pScore; strong indication of promiscuity</td></tr>

    <h3>Badapple Paper</h3>
    <p>For more information about Badapple please see the following paper:</p>
    <p><a href="https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0137-3" target="_blank">Badapple: promiscuity patterns from noisy evidence</a></p>
    <p>Although the original Badapple project was developed several years ago, we have re-created the original Badapple database and website using updated free and open-source software. See next section for more details.</p>
    <h3>What's different about this version?</h3>
    <p>The only differences between the current database (<b>badapple_classic</b>) and the 
        original database (<b>badapple</b>) are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>badapple_classic</b> uses the RDKit-based HierS algorithm 
                from <a href="https://github.com/UCLCheminformatics/ScaffoldGraph" target="_blank">ScaffoldGraph</a> 
                rather than <a href="https://github.com/unmtransinfo/unm_biocomp_hscaf" target="_blank">our Chemaxon-based version of HierS</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>badapple_classic</b> generates canonical SMILES using <a href="https://www.rdkit.org/" target="_blank">RDKit</a>, whereas <b>badapple</b> used <a href="https://openbabel.org/" target="_blank">openbabel</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>badapple_classic</b> uses a newer version of PostgreSQL with minor differences in median calculation
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We have performed several analyses to confirm that <b>badapple_classic</b> and <b>badapple</b> align closely. 
        Details on the analyses we've done can be found <a href="https://github.com/unmtransinfo/Badapple2/tree/main/badapple1_comparison#optional-compare-the-badapple-db-and-badapple_classic-db" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
