    <h1>Badapple</h1>
    <h3>(Bioassay-Data Associative Promiscuity Pattern Learning Engine)</h3>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Badapple identifies likely promiscuous compounds by analyzing bioactivity data associated with their scaffolds. Each input query molecule is analyzed by searching a database of bioactivity data experimentally 
        produced by NIH screening centers (data from <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PubChem</a>). For each scaffold in the query molecule, the Badapple promiscuity score (pScore) 
        is computed according to the following scaffold scoring formula:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <pre>
score = ((sActive) / (sTested + median(sTested)) *
        (aActive) / (aTested + median(aTested)) *
        (wActive) / (wTested + median(wTested)) *
        1e5)
        </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>where:</p>
    <blockquote>    
        <p>sTested = # tested substances containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>sActive = # active substances containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>aTested = # assays with tested compounds containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>aActive = # assays with active compounds containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>wTested = # wells (samples) containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>wActive = # active wells (samples) containing this scaffold</p>
        <p>median(sTested) = 2 </p>
        <p>median(aTested) = 634 </p>
        <p>median(sTested) = 773 </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The <b>inDrug</b> flag indicates whether the corresponding scaffold exists in any approved drug<sup>*</sup>. 
        A high score for an inDrug scaffold thus represents conflicting evidence, but existence of an 
        approved drug is normally much stronger evidence.</p>
    <p class="footnote"><small>* This analysis applies only to drugs with 5 ring systems or less. 
        Drugs with many ring systems (e.g., venetoclax) are excluded.</small></p>
    <p>Note that <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Benzene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">benzene</a> is not considered as a scaffold due to it being such a common substructure.</p>
    <h3>Interpreting Scores</h3>
    <p>The table below provides an overview of how to interpret different pScores provided by Badapple.</p>

        <td>unknown; no data</td></tr>
        <tr bgcolor="#86efac"><td>0-99</td>
        <td>low pScore; no indication</td></tr>
        <tr bgcolor="#fde68a"><td>100-299</td>
        <td>moderate pScore; weak indication of promiscuity</td></tr>
        <tr bgcolor="#fca5a5"><td>&ge;300</td>
        <td>high pScore; strong indication of promiscuity</td></tr>

    <p>Although the original Badapple project was developed several years ago, we have re-created the original Badapple database and website using updated free and open-source software. See next section for more details.</p>
    <h3>Databases: badapple vs badapple_classic vs badapple2</h3>
    Under the Badapple project there have been three unique databases developed so far. They can be summarized as follows:
    <ul>
        <li><b>badapple:</b> The original Badapple database developed several years ago which resulted in the publication of <a href="https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-016-0137-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Badapple: promiscuity patterns from noisy evidence</a>. This DB is not available as part of the webapp because it relies on outdated and proprietary code.</li>
        <li><b>badapple_classic:</b> Updated version of <b>badapple</b>, built using identical assay records and other data.</li>
        <li><b>badapple2:</b> Newest version of Badapple which incorporates an additional 83 new assay records.</li>
    </ul>
    For more information on the differences between these databases please see the next two sections.
    <h4>What's different between badapple and badapple_classic?</h4>
    <p>The only differences <b>badapple_classic</b> and <b>badapple</b> are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>badapple_classic</b> uses the RDKit-based HierS algorithm 
                from <a href="https://github.com/UCLCheminformatics/ScaffoldGraph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ScaffoldGraph</a> 
                rather than <a href="https://github.com/unmtransinfo/unm_biocomp_hscaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Chemaxon-based version of HierS</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>badapple_classic</b> generates canonical SMILES using <a href="https://www.rdkit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RDKit</a>, whereas <b>badapple</b> used <a href="https://openbabel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">openbabel</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>badapple_classic</b> counts ring systems using 
                <a href="https://github.com/PatWalters/useful_rdkit_utils/blob/master/useful_rdkit_utils/ring_systems.py#L17" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RingSystemFinder</a> 
                (RDKit-based), whereas <b>badapple</b> used 
                <a href="https://github.com/unmtransinfo/unm_biocomp_hscaf/blob/befd175da409b27374d005f6431a2df94e361d02/unm_biocomp_hscaf/src/main/java/edu/unm/health/biocomp/hscaf/hier_scaffolds_utils.java#L161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RawRingsystemCount</a> 
                (Chemaxon-based).
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>badapple_classic</b> uses a newer version of PostgreSQL
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We have performed several analyses to confirm that <b>badapple_classic</b> and <b>badapple</b> align closely. 
        Details on the analyses we've done can be found <a href="https://github.com/unmtransinfo/Badapple2/tree/main/badapple1_comparison#optional-compare-the-badapple-db-and-badapple_classic-db" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
        <h4>What's different between badapple_classic and badapple2?</h4>
        <p>The most significant differences between <b>badapple_classic</b> and <b>badapple2</b> are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>badapple_classic</b> uses the same set of (823) assays as the original badapple DB, whereas <b>badapple2</b> incorporates an additional 83 new assay records (906 total).
                    <ul>
                        <li>For both cases, assay records are restricted to HTS (>= 20k compounds) and come from NIH centers.</li>
                        <li>You can compare the files <a href="https://unmtid-dbs.net/download/Badapple2/badapple_classic_files/badapple_classic_tested.aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">badapple_classic_tested.aid</a> and <a href="https://unmtid-dbs.net/download/Badapple2/badapple2_files/badapple2_tested.aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">badapple2_tested.aid</a> to see the exact difference.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In addition to the 83 new assay records, <b>badapple2</b> also uses updated versions of the original 823 assay records.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>PubChem is constantly updated. Substances, compounds, and bioassays can be modified/removed over time. 
                            One particular way these updates have impacted <b>badapple2</b> is that some PubChem compounds have been removed since the creation of <b>badapple</b> (e.g., CIDs 6212642, 24761676, and 24762101). 
                            Thus, some scaffolds which are in <b>badapple_classic</b> may no longer be in <b>badapple2</b> (e.g., the scaffold with SMILES 'C1=C2CCCC=C2Nc2ccccc21').</li>
                        <li><b>badapple</b> & <b>badapple_classic</b> date cutoff: <i>2017-08-14</i></li>
                        <li><b>badapple2</b> date cutoff: <i>2024-11-26</i></li>
                    </ul>
                <li>
                    <b>badapple_classic</b> was restricted to substances from <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/source/MLSMR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLSMR</a>, whereas <b>badapple2</b> incorporates bioactivity data from all compounds tested in at least 50 unique assays.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Omitting this restriction often leads to an artificially reduced sActive/sTested ratio</li>
                        <li>This restriction was not necessary in <b>badapple_classic</b> due to the MLSMR filter</li>
                        <li>Because of this restriction many scaffolds in <b>badapple2</b> have a null pScore. However, even for these cases the website still provides inDrug information as well as assays where the scaffold was present in an active substance. Users can download a local version of <b>badapple2</b> (see instructions above) to explore bioactivity data from these cases and can test different NAT restrictions by following the instructions <a href="https://github.com/unmtransinfo/Badapple2/tree/main/snakemake#badapple2-number-of-assays-tested-analysis-nata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>badapple2</b> uses the <b>badapple_classic</b> medians to normalize pScores in order to ensure that our criteria for what constitutes a "high" amounts of evidence remains consistent.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Note that because we no longer use the MLSMR filter, there are many scaffolds present in <b>badapple2</b> which have a low amount of evidence. Using the <b>badapple2</b> medians to normalize scores would significantly lower the bar for what is considered enough evidence to assign a high pScore.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>In addition to the items above, <b>badapple2</b> stores information not present in <b>badapple_classic</b>, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Biological target information for each assay</li>
                <li>A record of the specific approved drug(s) a scaffold is present in if <b>inDrug</b> is true.
                <li>Assay descriptors (description and protocol text + annotations from <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4383997/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BARD</a>)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        If you select <b>badapple2</b> in the webapp, details on the associated biological targets and approved drugs are available for each scaffold.
